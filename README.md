# PathFinding Visualizer 
This project is a Pathfinding Visualizer built with React, which demonstrates how Dijkstra's Algorithm works. It provides a visual representation of the algorithm's process in finding the shortest path between two points on a grid. <br>

# Features <br/>
*Visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm <br/>
*Interactive grid layout <br/>
*Add walls/obstacles to the grid <br/>
*Step-by-step visualization of the algorithm <br/>
